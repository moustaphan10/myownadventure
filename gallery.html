    <p>MMP100| Digital Imaging Project<br>Title:Vector based Selfie Portrait<br>Semester:Fall 2020<br>Software:Illustrator<br>Description:for this project i tried to recreate a self-portrait of me and my daughter taken in the subway of New York. A memory of mine when my daughter first experience the subway, and express how happy she was. I picked this Bamboo background since it remind how fast she's growing up like a Bamboo i used to say. This project was very challenging for me throughout drawing the hat and face parts with vector was hard. I overcome this by using the curvative pen tool for perfecting the face shape and the brush tool for the hat plus the help of my professor.</p><hr>
