<h1>Welcome to Moustapha's website</h1>
       <img src="images/moustapha_pic350px.jpg" alt="Moustapha family" width="350px"/>
<p>My name is Moustapha Niakate. I am currently a 2ndyear student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC).  My major is computer network technology. I enjoy learning about the various aspects of the technology systems. I migrated to the United Stated from Mali, West Africa in 2015. When I was living in Mali, I had a background in law and business. However, when I arrived in the United States, I knew this would provide me with the perfect opportunity to combine the knowledge I’ve already acquired with and gain skills in computer networking technology.</p>
 <p>
Since I was a child, I’ve always had a curiosity centered on understanding how electronic devices work. I often enjoyed picking apart cellphones, Walkman’s, CD players, VCR and DVD players.  I often spent hours figuring out how to put it back together. When electronic devices of my family members and friends weren’t functioning correctly, I became the go to person to attempt to fix the issue. It always bought me great pleasure to help others in this way. Within my move from Africa to America, I discovered there was a societal change in which brands and operating systems were preferred. Back home, we prefer android’s and PC’s, whereas America is home to everything associated with Apple Inc. Nevertheless, I soon recognized that technology is a vital part of our everyday lives. Society is at a point, where we cannot function without technology because it’s embedded in every aspect of our lives including the ways we do business to healthcare systems. The computer technology field is growing constantly and I am interested in being apart and growing within this field as a leader. Also, this field will provide me with a great deal of flexibility due to the increase in demand in all major areas.</p>
 <p>
Computer network technology is not only a field that is booming. It is a field in which I take great pleasure in being able to learn and to help others when issues arise. It also allows me to assess issues as they arise, use critical thinking and analytical skills to resolve issues as they occur. I look forward to growing within field and taking advantage of the opportunities as they arise.</p>
<p> I took this picture at Cranegie Hall, went there for this big event: the concert of the Senegalese superstar Youssou Ndour a Grammy Award winning singer-songwriter and his band.Youssou Ndour has been named one of the world's "50 Great Voices by NPR. I love his music since i was little and he compose with many major musician accros the world. Being here in the US for over five years and going to this show was like me going back home for that night it was crowded and has electrified the audience with every appearance.</p>
