<h1> Moustapha's Story</h1>
   <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="my picture" width="500px"/> 
    
<p>My name is Moustapha Niakate. I am currently a 2nd year student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC).  My major is computer network technology. I enjoy learning about the various aspects of the technology systems. I migrated to the United Stated from Mali, West Africa in 2015. I am a husband and a father of a lovely little sweet girl named Halimata.When I was living in Mali, I had a background in law and business. However, when I arrived in the United States, I knew this would provide me with the perfect opportunity to combine the knowledge I’ve already acquired with and gain skills in computer networking technology.</p>
    
<p>I go to school full time and drive part time, the combination of both is not easy but as parent we need to provide for our family, which is not easy sometimes, sparing time for my family, school, and works. By coming here in America i learn a lot, like the cultural difference and the diversity of the population. I discovered there was a societal change in which brands and operating systems were preferred. Back home, we prefer android’s and PC’s, whereas America is home to everything associated with Apple Inc. Nevertheless, I soon recognized that technology is a vital part of our everyday lives. Society is at a point, where we cannot function without technology because it’s embedded in every aspect of our lives including the ways we do business to healthcare systems. The computer technology field is growing constantly and I am interested in being apart and growing within this field as a leader. Also, this field will provide me with a great deal of flexibility due to the increase in demand in all major areas.</p>
 <p>
Back home we call it Mali, a splendide and joyfull country, the Mali of Timbuktu, the Mali of Mansa Moussa is a landlocked country in west Africa the eight-largest country in Africa. we have many profond cultural influences bref. I just miss Mali.
     please visit Mali when you can i promise you won't regret it.
